I've been playing [**Red Dead Redemption 2**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174180/Red_Dead_Redemption_2/) on my SteamDeck and it's been a really great exerience.<!--more-->  For a game that is over 3 years old, I will spare you a review of the actual game.  We all know it's a well made game that is very loved by the community.  This is a review of the game on my SteamDeck.

## SteamDeck Experience

I've been playing this game mostly docked at 1080p simply because I feel it's so gorgeous looking it deserves to be seen on a larger screen.   I use the SteamDeck's native FSR 1.0 upscaling from 720 to 1080p because I feel it looks slightly nicer than the in game FSR 2.0.  I recognize that the in game FSR might net you a couple extra FPS, but I feel it muddies things a bit and I happily let the minor FPS boost go for the benefit of visual fidelity.



Most of my gameplay has been in the single player campaign, but do have a [Red Dead Online](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2901957434) character and have done some minor gameplay and feel the performance and fidelity are the same as the single player campaign (less the aspects of playing with other humans).

I really like how these look and feel, but I'll be honest..  I'm not a heavy track pad user.   That said, I feel they only enhance the trackpad.  

This is a sticker.. Or more like a vinyl decal.  That said it feels super high end. The material is super thin but strong feeling and it was cut exactly, and I mean exactly right to fit.    No gaps, no overlap.  Super well made.

I rate it **Almost 5 Stars** because

#### SteamDeck Settings

My personal settings. I play mostly docked at 1080 but also play on deck. When I do I just change the resolution from 720 to 800.

SteamDeck Settings

Go into the SteamDeck Settings (left menu) and set the resolution to your display. Mine is 1920x1080@120. This is the video signal resolution the deck will generate.

Go into the RDR2 SteamDeck Settings (gear icon, then settings): General - Game Resolution: Native

Change the Scaler

When in Game, press the (...) button to bring the left menu up.

Go to the Performance Menu (the one that is a battery)

Change 'Scaling Filter' to FSR.

Select a value for FSR Sharpness. (I'm using 5 for RDR2)

In Game Settings

I'm no expert but I went for a higher fidelity choice, you could prob go all medium settings for some extra frames but then you don't get all the rainbows in the mist and the extra pretty stuff. Resolution 1280x720 This is the frame size it will actually render.

This will make the game render at 720p and then the deck will upscale it to 1080p.
