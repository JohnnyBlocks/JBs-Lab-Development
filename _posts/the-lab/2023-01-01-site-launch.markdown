Happy New Year!  Today marks the launch of [JohnnyBlocks.com](https://JohnnyBlocks.com).

This site is a place for me and my friends to share thoughts and ideas we have on topics related to computers and gaming.  I will feature [Guides](https://johnnyblocks.com/how-to/index.html) and [Reviews](https://johnnyblocks.com/reviews/index.html) a
long with [stories](https://johnnyblocks.com/stories/index.html) about adventures in computer science and gaming.<!--more-->

## We are all Scientists

We call this site 'The Lab' because it's a place of experimentation.   Figuring out how to make things better.   I work as a computer scientist in a laboratory and found there is a lot of computer science overlap in gaming.

This site will be a place to share ways to make our gaming and computing experience better.

Much of it will focus on [Steam](https://steampowered.com/), the [SteamDeck](https://johnnyblocks.com/topics/steamdeck.html), Games, and [TeamSpeak](https://johnnyblocks.com/topics/teamspeak.html) but the whole video gaming ecosystem is full of topics and ideas that will be showcased here.

### Hand Crafted

This site and all the content is lovingly handcrated by [JohnnyBlocks](https://johnnyblocks.com/lab-crew/johnnyblocks.html) on his SteamDeck.  Keep an eye out for changes as we add content and add features to our site.

Thank you for stopping by.  If you find our content helpful or interesting, do us a solid and share it on your favorite social sites and stop by to see new content.
