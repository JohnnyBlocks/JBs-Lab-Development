## Clean TTS Soundpack

This [TeamSpeak](https://teamspeak.com) soundpack is short and sweet.  It gives you the minimum information needed to know what is happening.  Mostly user name and channel name is what is relayed via TTS.  Don’t forget to set your phonetic name.

Note: The voice used is configured in your PC’s control panel, ‘Text to Speech’ settings.  I use Hazel, who is British.  You can get additional voices and languages from [Microsoft Speech Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27224).
